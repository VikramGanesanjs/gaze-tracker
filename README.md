# Gaze Tracker Science Fair Project

## A model that is able to predict a user's gaze with less than 2 centimeters of error

## Using PyTorch, Mediapipe and OpenCV

# File Structure

#### train.py - Main Training loop for the model
#### net.py - Model Architecture
#### demo.py - Quick demo app made with Tkinter
#### gazer.py - application of the model to real-time webcam stream
#### data.py - Preprocessing of tablet-gaze dataset
#### gaze_capture_setup.py - Preprocessing of gaze-capture dataset
#### vgg.py - VGG-16 architecture that can be used for fine tuning
#### vgg_normalized.pth - PyTorch Model state dict for pretrained VGG-16 model that can be used for fine tuning
#### All other files should be disregarded as they are just demos or test files
